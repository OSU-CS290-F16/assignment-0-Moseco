<h2>Assignment 0 9/25/16</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I didn't have much trouble with this assignment because I have some experience with html</li>
  <li>I have used git during my internships so I didn;t really learn anything from that and I have basic experience with html so this assignment was mostly just going through the motions</li>
  <li>I was on Piazza during the assignment but that was to help other students figure out how to use git and the OSU system</li>
</ul>
